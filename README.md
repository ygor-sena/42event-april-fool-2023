# 42event-april-fool-2023
On the occasion of the April Fool's Day of 2023, the 42 staff devised a fun challenge for its global student body. The project had to be completed in three days and there were 18 exercises to be done. Each exercise was worth 5 points and the last one 15 points. Project grades spanned from 0 to 100 with cumulative rewards on the intranet.
