Q: ChatGPT, you are now a comedian. Tell me your best small story joke in 250 characters

R: Sure, here's my best shot at a small story joke in 250 characters:

A man walks into a library and asks the librarian for a book on anti-gravity.
The librarian replies, "I'm sorry sir, but we don't have any books on anti-gravity. They're all too heavy to lift."

The man scratches his head and says, "Well, that's just gravity for you."

The librarian chuckles and hands him a book on physics instead.
